	$ qtconfig

3. To view your CPU temperatures, type the following command

	$ sensors

##Create special user for file sharing

1. Create the system user:

	$ sudo useradd {username} -p {password} -g sambashare

2. Create the samba user:

	$ sudo smbpasswd -a {username}

3. Add the user to the /etc/samba/smbusers file:

	$ sudo su
	$ echo '{username} = "{username}"' > /etc/samba/smbusers

Note: when mounting partitions use the "sambashare" group as the mountpoint's group.

##Auto-mount partitions

1. Run the following command to get the UUID of the partitions:

	$ sudo blkid

2. Open the file /etc/fstab with any text editor (root privileges are required)

3. For each partition, add the following (single) line to the file:

UUID={uuid} /media/{mountname} {filesytem} rw,uid={username},gid=sambashare,umask=023 0 0

Notes:
{uuid} = The UUID of the partition
{mountname} = The name of the mount point
{filesystem} = The filesystem of the partiton

by setting the gid to "sambashare", the special samba user defined in the previous section can access shares on these partitions.

Example:
UUID=0001111100001100  /media/data ntfs, rw,uid=bob,gid=sambashare,umask=023 0 0
